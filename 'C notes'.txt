*Pointers are used for:
    -Strings -Dynamic memory allocation
    -Pointing to functions -Sending function-arguments by reference
    -Building complicated-data-structures and data-structures [Trees, Tries]
 Pointer [Integer-variable] = Memory-address that points to a value
 Computer's-Memory = Sequential store of data; Pointer points to a specific part of the memory

 Strings as pointers:
    Null-terminator [\0] = Character w/ ordinal-value of zero

 Dereferencing = Act of where the pointer points [i.e. the value]
 Eg. Accessing the any element in an array Eg. arrayName[0], arrayName[3]

**Introduction to C Programming
Escape sequences are used for representing non-printable characters in text

*What is programming?
Programming = Process of "writing  the collection of instructions" that a computer-machine 
    can understand and execute to perform a specific task and solve a particular problem

*Low-level-languages: Machine [Binary] language, Assembly language
    These language-instructions are closely-related or correspond directly to 
    specific-machine-instructions which are directly executed by the computer-machine's
    processor
    Closeness = Speed+ Efficiency+ Less consumption of memory+ Fine-grain-control over 
        computer-machine-hardware
    Machine-language[0 and 1] = Computer-machine-instructions+ Memory-locations
    Assembly-language [Mnemonics+ Symbols] also works closely w/ machine-instructions 
        but on a slightly-higher-level only

*What is the C Programming Language?
    C is procedural-programming-language

    Procedural-language = Series of instructions [Procedures+Functions] executed in a specific order
                            to perform tasks and accomplish goals
    Thus, C-programs = Functions-executed-sequentially following top-down-approach

*A Brief History of the C Programming Language
    Developed by Dennis Ritchie at AT&T Bell Laboratories
    C = Inspiration from [B+ Basic-Combined-Programming-Language [BCPL]] + Additional-features
    According to TIOBE index, C is the second most popular as of August2023
        [[TIOBE - The Importance Of Being Earnest]]
    This is because C is considered the "mother of programming-languages
    CPython [Python's interpreter and default implementation] is written in C
    C was originally designed w/ systems-programming in mind
    C-programs are portable [i.e. can b executed across different platforms w/ minimal changes]
    C allows dynamic-direct-memory-manipulation, thus ideal for performance-critical-applications

C is statically-typed-language [i.e. Datatype cannot b changed during runtime]
History: 1960 Algol [Algorithmic Language]
         1963 CPL [Combined Programming Language]
         1967 BCPL [Basic Combined Programming Language]
         1972-73 C by (Dennis Ritchie-Ken Thompson)
UNICS first OS which was implemented in C [All other OSs were implemented using Assembly-language]
[[UNiplexed Information Computing System [UNICS] 
https://byjus.com/gate/unix-full-form/#:~:text=The%20Full%20Form%20of%20UNIX%20(also%20referred%20to%20as%20UNICS,in%201969%2C%20UNIX%20is%20powerful.
]]
Many things became easier to implement using 'C' language such as "FORTRAN"-compiler
In 1989, [American National Standards Institute] ANSI-C started standardising C-language, 
    since it started becoming popular
Different compiler(s) show different behaviour for a same particular C-code-program thus 
    creating problems like the C-code-program working in Turbo-C-compiler but errors in GCC-compiler
    Thus C90-standard came in 1990,
         C95-standard came in 1995

Learn C Language In 10 Minutes!! C Language Tutorial [1.24/10.35][Only watched 8/10.35]
Invented by Dennis Ritchie at AT&T Bell Laboratories in early 1970s
Ideas taken from 'B' Language and its ancestors CPL, and BCPL
C is Middle-level-language can b used for system-level-programming like writing OS,
    developing applications and games.
Structured-Programming-Language [Programs = Functions+Modules]
Compiler [GCC, Clang widely used] required to be installed
.c extension and mandatory main() function inside the file
Other header-files [.h] can be imported into .c files 
    [ #include<StandardCLibraryFile.h> ] Eg. #include<stdio.h> [includes scanf (used for 
                                                                input) and printf (used 
                                                                for output) functions]
    [ #include"CustomisedOwnHeaderFile.h"] Eg. #include"filename.h"
    There are 32 keywords in C language: auto, break, case, char, const, continue, 
                                        default, do, 
                                        double, else, enum, extern, float, for, goto, if,

Idea of Algorithms [Watched-27.46]
Problems that can b solved through programming:
    Whereever the steps to execute to arrive at the desired result are known, only such 
    problems can b resolved
Programming = Set of instructions to be provided to a computer-machine to solve a 
            problem
            Computer-machine = An electronic machine made of switches understanding only
            0 [zeros] and 1 [ones]

*What is a computer?
    A machine which can accept data, process them and output results
    The specified sequence of steps is remembered by the computer-machine in its memory
    Each 0 or 1 is known as binary-digit [i.e. bit]
    Binary Number System [0, 1]

    A computer-machine understands only machine-language [i.e. 0 and 1 language]
    Compiler = Translator that converts high-level-language to machine-language
